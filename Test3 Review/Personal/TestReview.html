      The FitnessGram Pacer test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that
      progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter Pacer test
      will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts
      slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal *boop*.

      A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound *ding*.
      Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The
      second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is
      over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready,
      start.

      You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! "What's the difference?" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
